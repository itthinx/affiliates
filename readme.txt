The Affiliates system provides powerful tools to maintain an Affiliate Marketing Program.

== Description ==

The Affiliates system provides powerful tools to maintain an Affiliate Marketing Program.

_Important features include automated affiliate registration, an unlimited affiliate management section and the ability to integrate Affiliates with virtually any E-Commerce platform. Commissions on referred users are built in, free and premium integrations with e-commerce systems are available._

**The Affiliates plugin provides an affiliate system for sellers, shops, and membership sites who want to get started with their affiliate program right "out of the box".**

It also provides a solid framework for developers, who wish to build customized solutions based on a sound data model. With unlimited affiliate program management tools available on the back end and a set of shortcodes to provide Affiliates information on their performance on the front end, there is everything you need to start an affiliate program.

To manage an **Affiliate Marketing** or **Partner Referral Program** and **track visits to your site** with **affiliate links**, the _Affiliates_ plugin is a powerful solution.

Simply put, the affiliates plugin is used to manage affiliates, create referrals and track visits to your site through affiliate links.
Referrals are stored and attributed to an affiliate, for example if clients place orders on your site and you need to credit your affiliates. You can show your affiliates how well they perform, by embedding simple shortcodes on a page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there an option to create an Affiliate Area? =

You can let Affiliates generate an Affiliate Area page for you.
Go to _Affiliates > Settings > Pages_ and press the _Generate_ button.
You will find a new page titled _Affiliate Area_ on your site which includes a login form, affiliate registration form, information about an affiliate's performance and the affiliate's link as well as a link to log out at the end of the page.
You can edit this page and adjust it according to your preferences. 

= How can I show affiliates their affiliate link? =

Note: You can create a page and embed a shortcode manually, or you can create an Affiliate Area as outlined above.

Embed this shortcode on a page:

[affiliates_url]

This will render a link to your site with the affiliate ID appended.

If you want to link to a certain page, you can use this shortcode:

[affiliates_url]http://www.example.com/somepage[/affiliates_url]

If you want to show how a link would look like, you can use the shortcode within HTML as well, for example:

&lt;a href="[affiliates_url]"&gt;[affiliates_url]&lt;/a&gt;

Remember to use HTML entities for < and >.

= How can I show affiliates information about their performance? =

Detailed information on this is available on the [Affiliates Documentation](http://www.itthinx.com/documentation/affiliates/) pages.

Note: You can create a page and embed a shortcode manually, or you can have the plugin create an Affiliate Area for you.

The number of hits on an affiliate's link can be shown with the [affiliates_hits] shortcode.

The number of visits on an affiliate's link can be shown with the [affiliates_visits] shortcode.

Your affiliates will want to know how much they will and have earned and how many referrals they have made.

Use the [affiliates_referrals] shortcode to show how many referrals an affiliate has made and how much the affiliate has earned.

The [affiliates_referrals] shortcode will show the total number of referrals that have been accepted or closed for the affiliate.

To show the number of referrals for an affiliate by status, embed it like this:

Examples:

- Accepted referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="accepted"]
- Closed referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="closed"]
- Pending referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="pending"]
- Rejected referrals: [affiliates_referrals status="rejected"]

If you add the show="total" attribute to that shortcode, it will make a list of earnings by currency:

Examples:

Total amount for paid and unpaid referrals: [affiliates_referrals show="total"]

- Total for unpaid referrals: [affiliates_referrals show="total" status="accepted"]
- Total for paid referrals: [affiliates_referrals show="total" status="closed"]
- Total for referrals pending approval: [affiliates_referrals show="total" status="pending"]
- Total for rejected referrals: [affiliates_referrals show="total" status="rejected"]

= Is it possible to show content for affiliates or non-affiliates only? =

* Embed the content that you want to show to affiliates like this:

    [affiliates_is_affiliate]

    This is visible to affiliates who are logged in only.

    [/affiliates_is_affiliate]

* For content to show to non-affiliates use this:

    [affiliates_is_not_affiliate]

    You can see this if you are not logged in as an affiliate.

    [/affiliates_is_not_affiliate]

= Can we generate affiliate links for our partners? =

Yes.

Affiliate links are available for registered affiliates and they can see
them in the Affiliate Area. You can also customize these and let them
link to any page on your site.

= Can we track visits to our site through our partners' sites? =

Yes.

The Affiliates system tracks visits via affiliate links to any page on
your site. It also allows to track referred user registrations and order,
while recording related commissions through referrals and transaction data.

= Can we register commissions manually? =

Yes.

Commissions are registered manually via the Referrals section in the
Affiliates menu.

= Can we grant commissions when affiliates refer new users? =

Yes.

The built-in user registration integration allows to grant commissions
for new user sign-ups.

= Can we record referrals automatically when, for example, an order is placed? =

Yes.

The API provides the means to suggest referrals and record them.

= I am an affiliate of ACME and they provided me with an affiliate link. Is this plugin for me? =

No it isn't.

This plugin is for sites that need to manage *their* affiliates.

= Can I automatically store additional referral and transaction data? =

Yes you can do that through the plugin's API functions.

= I need to keep track of all transactions, including those that have not been initiated via an affiliate. Is this possible? =

Yes!

Referrals that are not attributable to an affiliate can be stored along with arbitrary transaction data and associated with the site owner.
There is a dedicated entry for that, called *Direct* in the affiliates list, representing the site owner.

= What about timezones? =

The plugin provides timezone-independent recording and retrieval of hits, visits and referrals.
Data is stored with reference to the server's settings and shown adjusted to the timezone settings in your WordPress site.

= How flexible is data recording and retrieval for referrals? =

You can store any information you need along with referrals.

= Is it possible to create affiliate links to any page on my site? =

Yes.

= Is it possible to have affiliate links to specific posts? =

Yes.

= How fine-grained are permissions? =

The plugin provides role-based permissions to access gathered affiliate data, administer affiliates and administer options.

= Can I change the content of the email that new affiliates receive? =
